# Art Blocks Community Tooling
A collection of open source tools, built in collaboration with the Art Blocks community!

> :warning: This is a community tool set with contributions from external community members. Please use caution and know that you should NEVER enter private keys, seed phrases, or any other sensitive information when using these tools.

## Organization
Each tool is in its own directory. Some tools are written in Python, others in node, and future tools may use other languages. 

Each tool's directory should have:
- `readme.md`: provides a general overview of how to install dependencies and use the tool.

## Contributing
Anyone from the Art Blocks community is encouraged to participate in the improvement of this repository. Please submit PRs or reach out to developers on Discord if you have any questions.

A special thank you to [@xenoliss](https://github.com/xenoliss) for their work implementing the initial versions of the `ArtistAssistant` and `RoyaltiesProcessorDelivery` scripts, not captured by the git history here in this repo.
